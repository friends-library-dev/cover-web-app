  "blurb": "Christopher Healy (1773-1851) joined the Society of Friends when 19 years old, and being faithful in the “day of small things,” grew strong in the grace of God and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ. He became an eminent minister of the gospel during the sad time of declension and division in the mid 1800’s. When many nominal Quakers were departing to the right and to the left, Christopher Healy was among the few who kept to the ancient path and “contended earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints.”",
